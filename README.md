# Bench RestTest take-home test 

The following repo contains my solution to the Bench Rest Test take-home test using Python 3

Here is a high level overview of my project: 
  - Python 3 has a number of libraries and packages that can be used to interact with HTTP resources. I decided that the best choice is [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/) for it's simplicity and built-in methods to handle JSON responses. 

  - Using requests, I was able to retrieve the site information and then process the responses using two processor functions I created. 

  - All my scripts have been checked with [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) and I created a test suite using [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) which is is a no-boilerplate alternative to Pythonâ€™s standard unittest module.
